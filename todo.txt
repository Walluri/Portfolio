Menu : why so much gap in the pop-ups.

1. Home Page : Text about description must be changed.
 	    : Why is the description not highlighting yourself as a react and node developer
	   
 - mobile view : alignment of icons and contact info
 - desktop view - same as above
 - chitti phani idea of changing home page text
 - desktop view : the photo is big.
- in home page the phone icon and phone number are not inline + email also.
- shoulder level picture should be thereer.
- title animate should happen from top to bottom.


2. skills page : 3 svg icons must have the same color
        	   : change the icon for cloud.. its like a download symbol
                    : React and Node logo must be same and same color also ?		
	    : Scalable such gramatical mistakes should be corrected.

3. Experience :
 text should be in center.
 Responsive design close button is overlapping.
 line must animate from left to right.
